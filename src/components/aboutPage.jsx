                Our mini project is a web application designed to showcase various food itemDetails
                along with their names, pictures, whether its a high caloric unhealthy foodchoise option or a low caloric healthy one.
                Users also have the ability to interect with the displayed food items in several ways such as:  

                <ul>

                        <strong>Viewing and Deleting:</strong> Users can browse through the list of displayed food items on the website. Additionally, they 
                        have the option to delete food items from the page, providing a sense of custamization and control over the displayed content.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Detailed View:</strong> Clicking on a specific food item enables users to acces more detailed information about the food, such as
